  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Celebrating NIF Ignition</h1>
  <div class="textcolumn">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>On December 13, 2022, the US Department of Energy (DOE) held a
    press conference announcing that a laser fusion capsule shot at
    the National Ignition Facility (NIF) on December 5 had achieved
    ignition.  This capsule produced 3 megajoules (MJ) of fusion
    energy when it was illuminated by 2 MJ of laser light.  Getting
    more fusion energy out than energy put in is usually called
    &ldquo;break even,&rdquo; but for the purpose of defining NIF's
    middle initial when it was being built, the fusion community
    agreed that break even would unquestionably demonstrate
    &ldquo;ignition.&rdquo;  So what this announcement really means is
    that everyone now agrees that NIF has begun to do the job its
    designers promised.</p>
  <p>I am a PhD physicist who designed targets for NIF and its
    predecessors from 1980 until my retirement on the last day of
    2019.  In addition to designing targets, I contributed to the
    design of the NIF laser itself - so I know a lot about both the
    laser and the targets it shoots.  Although the
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2ktAL4rGuY">DOE
    announcement</a> and especially the subsequent
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmzep3YaRNI">panel
      discussion</a> were well done, the media coverage focused on
    the pie-in-the-sky prospects for fusion (whether magnetic or
    inertial) as a commercial energy source, completely obscuring
    the real importance of the achievement.  The immediate benefit
    of NIF in general and ignition in particular has to do with
    its mission to understand nuclear weapons without needing to
    set them off.  The less tangible benefit is to generate
    excitement for science like marquee NASA missions or particle
    accelerators.</p>
  <p>Here I want to try to capture the wonder of what we built, and
    explain our obsession with nuclear fusion using a few pictures of
    fusion targets and the NIF laser.  The best answer for why we are
    trying to ignite fusion reactions comes down to the challenge of
    the thing.  The closest cliche is probably why people climb
    mountains or more aptly why societies build monuments.  Sometimes
    these challenges turn out to be useful - for example etching a
    billion logic gates onto a silicon chip - but more often your only
    concrete reward is the satisfaction and pride of doing something
    hard.  As the decades have passed it has become more and more
    obvious that the reason to pursue fusion is not for the original
    goal of generating electricity.  Given the 70 years of concerted
    effort spent on this small first step, fusion energy is obviously
    science fiction - or at the very least economic fiction.  It's
    time we were more honest about why studying fusion is
    worthwhile.</p>

  <h2 id="target">Target</h2>
  <p>Nuclear fusion, unlike nuclear fission, requires heating the
    reactants to an enormous temperature for them to collide hard
    enough to overcome a very large (by chemical standards) activation
    energy.  The unit of temperature we use in fusion target design is
    the keV, for kilo-electron-Volt, which is 11.6 million Kelvin (or
    degrees Celsius - the difference between degrees absolute and
    relative to the melting point of water is completely negligible).
    Fusion fuel, a mixture of deuterium and tritium, heavy isotopes of
    hydrogen, has to be heated to 4 to 5 keV before it will begin to
    react fast enough to heat the fuel to the more than 15 keV it must
    reach to burn vigorously - the self-heating process called
    ignition.  Thus the challenge of fusion is to figure out how to
    heat the fuel to 50 million degrees - ten thousand times
    temperature of the surface of the Sun - while holding it together
    long enough for it to ignite and burn.</p>
  <p>Anything that hot will explode and fly apart very quickly (unless
    you can contain it in a magnetic bottle - but that's another
    story), so you need to arrange things so that it burns more
    quickly than it flies apart.  Like any binary reaction, the fusion
    reaction rate is proportional to the density of the fuel.  The
    time it takes to fly apart, on the other hand, is proportional to
    its size - its radius if it is a ball.  A ball of fusion fuel at
    solid density the size of a grapefruit is a hydrogen bomb, so at a
    much smaller size that won't level the surrounding countryside,
    you need to compress the fusion fuel to enormous densities in
    order to get the density-radius product it needs to burn before it
    flies apart.</p>
  <p>NIF ignition capsules accomplish this by imploding a one
    millimeter radius hollow shell of solid hydrogen fusion fuel by a
    factor of about 20 in radius, crushing it to about a thousand
    times its ordinary solid density.  We grow the initial solid
    hydrogen shell inside a hollow sphere made of diamond by lowering
    it to cryogenic temperatures.  To accomplish the implosion, we
    mount the diamond capsule at the center of a tiny oven (called a
    hohlraum) about the size of a pencil eraser.  The NIF laser beams
    rapidly heat the inside of this oven to about 0.3 keV.  That's not
    nearly enough to ignite the fusion reaction, but it causes the
    outside of the diamond capsule to explode producing several
    hundred million atmospheres of pressure that implodes the inside
    of the capsule and its fusion fuel.  The compressive heating from
    that implosion produces the 4 or 5 keV in the fuel that ignites
    it, and its high density ensures it will burn before it flies
    apart.  The time scale for the implosion is a few nanoseconds; the
    time scale for the fusion burn is about a tenth of a
    nanosecond.</p>

       alt="diamond ignition capsule" />
  <p>Here is a 2 mm diameter diamond ignition capsule in all its glory
    before it is mounted inside the hohlraum.  Note the jet black
    color of nanocrystalline diamond - transparent gemstones are giant
    single crystals.  If you look very closely above the target you
    can just make out the glass fill tube - the whisker at the top the
    capsule is hanging from.  That tube is only a few microns in
    diameter, but it is hollow and there is a 2 micron hole through
    the shell under it that will be used to fill the capsule with
    deuterium-tritium fuel before the shot.</p>

  <img style="width:100%; margin: 1em;"
       src="niftarget.jpeg"
       alt="diagram of ignition target" />
  <!-- https://lasers.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/news/status/hohlraum_tents.jpg -->
  <p>We suspend the capsule at the center of a hollow can called a
    hohlraum, tented between two ultra thin polyimide films.  The
    inner walls of the hohlraum are made of uranium coated by a thin
    layer of gold.  The upper and lower hohlraum halves are thin
    sleeves press fit into an aluminum can which provides both
    mechanical support and thermal conductivity - the
    thermo-mechanical package (TMP).  96 laser beams enter through the
    top laser entrance hole (LEH), and 96 enter through the bottom.
    Each LEH is covered by a very thin polyimide film window which the
    lasers quickly burn through.  This film is necessary because the
    hohlraum is filled with a hydrogen and helium gas to tamp the
    inner walls when the laser hits them and to conduct heat to hold
    the capsule at crygenic temperature before the shot.  The storm
    window over the laser entrance holes had to be added in order to
    prevent ice from condensing on the LEH window from the
    not-quite-perfect vacuum of the target chamber.  The black silicon
    cooling arms (covered by crinkled unconverted light shields) both
    support the hohlraum at chamber center and conduct heat away to
    hold the target at cryogenic temperatures.</p>

  <img style="width:60%; float:right; margin: 1em;"
       src="http://inapcache.boston.com/universal/site_graphics/blogs/bigpicture/nif_10_08/n22_00000002.jpg"
       alt="ignition hohlraum size" />
  <p>Here is a hohlraum without the crinkly foil covers that will
    eventually cover the black silicon cooling arms holding it at the
    top and bottom.  (Without the crinkles, the flat silicon arm
    surfaces would reflect the unfocused unconverted light of a NIF
    beam entering from one side of the target chamber directly into
    the optics of the beam on the opposite side of the chamber,
    severely damaging them.)  If you look carefully, you can see the
    silicon ring that holds the top of the hohlraum is cut into an
    intricate pattern so only a ring of rectangular pads touch the
    hohlraum cylinder.  If you follow back from each of those contact
    points to where the fingers are holding the arms, you will find
    that the distances are all the same, so that heat will be
    conducted perfectly radially away from the axis of the hohlraum
    cylinder even though the paddle handle extends in only one
    direction.</p>

  <img style="width:60%; float:left; margin: 1em;"
    src="https://lasers.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/media/photo-gallery/medium/nif-1209-18047.jpg"
    alt="ignition hohlraum" />
  <p>The holes with spokes cut into the vertical walls of the hohlraum
    are lines of sight for the X-ray tomography setup required to
    monitor the layer growth in the cryo target positioner where the
    layer is grown before it moves the final 20 feet to target chamber
    center a couple of hours before the shot.  Incidentally, what you
    are looking at is an aluminum sleeve (despite its apparent gold
    color in this photo).  The hohlraum itself is press fit into this
    sleeve - the only part of the hohlraum itself visible in this
    picture is the gold arc forming the laser entrance hole (LEH) at
    the top.  The LEH window has not been installed yet on this
    target, so you can still see it.  You can also see the wires
    connected to two dark rings above and below center of the can -
    those are heaters used to precisely adjust the vertical
    temperature gradient which is critical to growing a perfectly
    concentric frozen hydrogen layer inside the capsule.</p>

  <img style="width:60%; float:right; margin: 1em;"
       src="https://lasers.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/about/new/about/nif-shot-insertion.jpg"
       alt="target in shroud" />
  <p>Here's a completed ignition target just before the cryogenic
    shroud is closed.  Note the windows in the shroud needed to be
    able to see the target to align the lasers and diagnostics on it
    after the fuel layer has been grown and it has been moved to
    chamber center.  I don't know this for sure, but the shroud is
    probably opened when the layer is being grown in the target
    positioner chamber before the shot - this photo is while it is
    being loaded into that system.  If you look closely, you can still
    see the heater rings around the TMP here for reference.  About 10
    seconds before the shot, the shroud will open like a clamshell and
    fold all the way back close to 180 degrees from its current
    position to avoid destruction.  The hinges are just slightly out
    of focus at the upper left.  The target and silicon arms are
    instantly vaporized when the laser fires, and the copper tube you
    see here is bent back and badly burned - the energy absorbed by
    the target is equivalent to about a half pound of TNT (and if it
    ignites, another half pound of TNT fusion yield).</p>

  <img style="width:60%; float:left; margin: 1em;"
       src="https://lasers.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/media/photo-gallery/web/P2111668-medium.jpg"
       alt="ignition shot" />
    <p>And bang!  An ignition shot.  This is a black and white image -
      the colors just represent brightness in the original image.  You
      can see the fully open cryo shroud on the arm at the left -
      that's what the target was connected to.  The diagnostic snouts
      at the top and right hold pinhole arrays for two X-ray framing
      cameras making movies of the shot viewed from above and from
      the side.  The snout on the left above the target positioner and
      open shroud holds a much more complex array of pinholes for a
      neutron imaging diagnostic.  The funky little thing that looks
      light a gunsight atop the framing camera snout on the right
      supports a foil that converts neutrons to protons for a magnetic
      recoil spectrometer.  Many more diagnostics are farther away
      than these close in components.  The little white flecks or
      stars visible around the dark edges of the image are not
      debris from the target - it was completely vaporized - but
      are caused by fusion neutrons zipping through the camera.
      The diagnostic instruments must also cope with this effect,
      often making them much more difficult to design.</p>

  <img style="width:60%; float:right; margin: 1em;"
       src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Edward-Moses-2/publication/238613582/figure/fig3/AS:670700260057095@1536918811704/Cryogenic-layered-target-shot-on-September-29-2010-a-before-and-b-after-being-shot.ppm"
       alt="spent target after shot" />
  <p>The aftermath.  This was the only picture I could find showing
    what it looks like immediately after a shot.  You have a really
    good view here of the cryo shroud in its fully open and retracted
    position.  You can also see the X-ray framing camera snouts coming
    in from the left and top.  The forlorn little wires dangling at
    the lower right are all that's left of the heater and thermocouple
    wires that were running out the silicon arms.  But the most
    impressive thing is the remains of the bright copper tube in the
    above closing shroud photo - you see the dark strip wrapping
    around the bright circular disk behind the dangling wires?  That
    copper tube has been split in half and wrapped backwards by the
    force of the vaporized target wind.  Pretty impressive considering
    all we did is shine a bright light on the target...</p>

  <h2 id="laser">Laser</h2>

  <img style="width:70%; float:right; margin: 1em;"
       src="nif.png" alt="NIF and surroundings."/>
  <p>Here is a portrait of the National Ignition Facility against the
    Livermore hills.  The Altamont Pass windfarm is visible on the
    horizon along the ridgeline to the left.  The cream colored
    structure is one side of the switchyard where the laser beams turn
    from the laser bays stretching behind to the target chamber.  The
    green cube in front is the target diagnostics building; the target
    chamber is at its intersection with the switchyard.  The overall
    design is oddly reminiscent of a cathedral with the switchyard as
    the transept and diagnostic building as sanctuary, although the
    laser bays would be two parallel naves.
  </p>

  <img style="width:70%; float:left; margin: 1em;"
       src="nif-building.png" alt="NIF cutaway."/>
  <p style="clear:right;">
    A cutaway view shows that the NIF laser fills the building.  NIF
    is the largest laser in the world, capable of delivering roughly
    50 times the energy of the second largest laser.  The main and
    power amplifiers for each beamline contain over a ton of
    neodymium-doped laser glass, or 200 tons for the entire 192 beam
    facility.  This is how much lasing medium you need to be able to
    heat the tiny target capsule to thermonuclear ignition - a giant
    warehouse full of laser.  The overriding design consideration for
    NIF was to build the lowest cost laser, not the most efficient
    laser.  It takes about 400 MJ of electrical energy (over five
    minutes at one megawatt) to charge the capacitor banks that fire
    the flashlamps that pump the 200 tons of laser glass to deliver
    that 2 MJ pulse of light to the target.</p>

  <img style="width:70%; float:right; margin: 1em;"
       src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ruth-Hawley-2/publication/293808036/figure/fig4/AS:614388448903168@1523493029248/Line-replaceable-units-are-the-optical-building-blocks-of-NIF.png" alt="Line replaceable units are the optical building blocks of NIF."/>
  <p>This diagram shows the full-sized optics in the NIF laser.  Each
    of the 192 laser beams has roughly a 35 cm square cross section -
    square because you can pack square beams closer together.  If the
    beams were any smaller, the laser beams would destroy the optics.
    Over two billion watts per square centimeter of unfocused light
    passes through these optics on the way to the target.  For
    comparison, full sunlight reaching Earth is one tenth of a watt
    per square centimeter, and even at the surface of the Sun sunlight
    is only six thousand watts per square centimeter.  So each NIF
    beam is nearly half a million times brighter than the surface of
    the Sun <em>before</em> focusing onto the target.  The optics
    in the laser bays are mounted in stacks of four beams called
    columns; a pair of columns is called a bundle; six bundles side
    by side is a cluster; each laser bay contains two clusters.</p>

   <img style="width:70%; float:left; margin: 1em;"
       src="https://lasers.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/about/how_nif_works/amplifier-plenums.jpg" alt="Worker standing atop main amplifer."/>
  <p>This worker is on top of one of the 24 main amplifier bundles -
    eight of the 192 NIF beams are in the box he is standing on.  Each
    cable connects to a two meter tall xenon flashlamp (like in a
    camera but a lot bigger).  A huge electrical pulse from the
    capacitor banks energizes the flashlamps about a microsecond
    before the shot.  It also triggers a frightful corona discharge
    where he is standing, but unfortunately I couldn't find a picture
    of that.  The flashlamps pump the pink neodymium glass
    amplifier slabs, storing the energy that the laser pulse will
    extract in the few billionths of a second of the shot.  The entire
    laser pulse is under ten feet long - less than the distance
    between this man and the photographer.</p>

  <img style="width:100%; float:left; margin: 1em;"
       src="oab.jpg" alt="Inside optical assembly building."/>
  <p>The optics assembly building (behind the laser bays) is where
    large optics are mounted and refurbished.  One column of pink
    neodymium glass amplifier slabs is on the right.  Each slab
    weighs about 80 pounds.  The technicians are working on one column
    of plasma electrode Pockels cells (PEPC) laying on its side on the
    left.  These are large optical switches made of KDP (potassium
    dihydrogen phosphate, a salt).  A perfectly timed electrical pulse
    applied to the PEPC traps then releases the laser pulse so it
    makes four passes through the main amplifier instead of just two.
    Being able to build a PEPC at this size was one of several
    significant technical risks of the NIF design; all these difficult
    design challenges were met.
  </p>

  <img style="width:45%; float:left; margin: 1em;"
       src="https://lasers.llnl.gov/content/assets/images/about/how_nif_works/target-chamber-tall.jpg" alt="Worker standing atop main amplifer."/>
  <p>This is a composite view of the NIF target chamber with several
    concrete floors separating the different levels removed (hence the
    strange apparently floating handrails and support beams).  The
    blue target chamber is a vacuum chamber ten meters in diameter.
    The huge rectangular tubes attached to the top and bottom of the
    chamber are the final optical assemblies (FOA), each of which
    houses a &ldquo;quad&rdquo; of four laser beams in a rectangular
    arrangement.  It would obviously be impossible to squeeze more
    laser beams into the available space - in fact, that consideration
    determined the size of the target chamber.  Most of the diagnostic
    instruments - a few of which are visible here - are therefore near
    the equator of the chamber at the center of this picture.  The
    final optics include more KDP optics - doubler and tripler
    crystals which convert the infrared pulse output from the
    amplifiers, first partially into a green pulse, then into a mostly
    ultraviolet pulse.  The wedged final focus lens deflects the
    residual infrared and green light - called unconverted light - so
    that it misses the laser entrance holes in the hohlraum.  A vacuum
    window, debris shields, a phase plate and a polarization rotator
    complete the stack of final optics inside the FOA.  Slow but
    steady improvements in the management of damage to these final
    optics are a big part of how the laser engineers have pushed NIF
    from its maximum design energy of 1.8 MJ to slightly over 2 MJ
    today.</p>

  <h2 style="clear:both;" id="history">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Many very smart people have been thinking long and hard how to
    ignite a thermonuclear fusion reaction.  The hydrogen bomb, first
    demonstrated in 1952, involves using a fission bomb to heat the
    fusion fuel.  Most of the 70 years of effort to ignite fusion
    reactions at laboratory scale has been spent developing magnetic
    bottles to confine the super hot fuel (real-life cousins of the
    force fields of science fiction), culminating in the ITER device
    under construction in France.  The laser fusion research leading
    to NIF began in earnest in 1972.</p>
  <p>Unlike magnetic fusion, laser fusion acquired immediate practical
    importance in 1993: The US has been able to stop testing its
    nuclear weapons while maintaining the technical expertise to
    understand how they work in part because of large lasers like NIF.
    The lasers partly substitute for nuclear tests by providing a way
    to experiment with densities and temperatures otherwise found only
    in nuclear weapons.  With its new ignition capability, NIF now
    allows us to study fusion burn without setting off a nuclear bomb.
    Avoiding nuclear weapons testing is an important job that NIF has
    been doing and can do better with ignition experiments.</p>
  <p>Using fusion - whether inertially or magnetically confined - to
    generate electricity, on the other hand, is a non-starter.  After
    70 years, we still don't know whether it is possible.  What we
    have learned is that even if it is possible it will be a
    tremendously expensive way to generate electricity - in other
    words, fusion is not a practical energy source.  You'd need to
    build, fill, and shoot of order half a million of those cryogenic
    diamond capsules <em>per day</em> in a fusion power plant.  It is
    ludicrous to pass that off as a mere engineering challenge.
    Furthermore, in a pure fusion economy you need to integrate your
    fusion reactor with a nuclear fission reactor that splits lithium
    to make tritium, because the fusion fuel is half tritium.  (Yes,
    deuterium can fuse with itself, but the reactivity of that
    reaction is a hundred times less than the deuterium-tritium
    reaction, which puts it completely out of reach for any
    laboratory-sized machine.  Proposals to use any fuel other than
    deuterium-tritium are completely unrealistic.)</p>
  <p>Finally, the one good media question asked at the DOE panel
    discussion was to describe the changes that had been made to
    achieve ignition at NIF.  The question was answered very narrowly,
    describing the minor changes over the past few months.  However,
    I believe the intended question was, &ldquo;Why did it take 12
    years for NIF to achieve ignition?&rdquo;  The answer is that
    before 2016, we tried over and over again to make something like
    the original NIF capsule design work - the design we used to
    sell the laser.  This design would burn up something like a
    third of the fuel, because it imploded to a much higher density.
    These original designs converged a factor of 30 to 40 in radius,
    but never performed as well as our simulations predicted.  After
    2016, we began to design capsules with lower convergence.</p>
  <p>The capsule that finally ignited only converged about a factor of
    20 in radius.  Because of its lower density-radius product, it
    burned only about 4% of its fuel before disassembly.  This doesn't
    matter if you are simply studying a burning plasma, but if you are
    trying to generate electricity it's not acceptable.  At any power
    plant scale, you need the higher convergence in order to burn a
    decent fraction of the fuel in each capsule.  And the lesson of
    NIF so far has been that capsules designed to converge in radius
    by a factor of more than about 20 don't work.  I'm sure that one
    of the main thrusts of the research at NIF will now be to try to
    push the convergence up, but there's no reason to suppose that the
    original high convergence regime can be reached.</p>
  <p>To close on a more positive note, the most compelling reason to
    pursue either inertial or magnetic fusion is the same as the
    reason to build any other monument.  Driving rovers on Mars, or
    flying the Webb space telescope, or searching for Higgs bosons
    with a giant accelerator are other monument-type projects.  Like
    the big fusion machines, they answer questions for the sake of
    curiosity - not because we need to know but because we want to
    know.  We aren't sure what we will find - only that the search
    will stretch our ideas about the universe to the limit.  These are
    exciting ideas which pull people into science.  I got paid to
    vaporize stuff with giant lasers.  How cool a job is that?</p>
